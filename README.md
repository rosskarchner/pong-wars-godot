# Pong Wars Godot

A simple re-creation of the excellent [Pong Wars by Koen van Gilst](https://pong-wars.koenvangilst.nl/), made with Godot 4.

I did add a couple of goodies: you can left-click to switch any block between day and night, or right-click to change switch ALL of the blocks at once.
